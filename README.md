# Introduction
This was a semester project in Databases course where we had to build a managment system for a newspaper which 

consists from different  users such as Journalists, Editors, Administrators, and Publishers. For this project we 

used neatbeans IDE and mySQL for the database. Every uses logs in with his username and password if he is registered 

in the database the appropriate GUI with all the available options appears. Below we present all the requirments for 

every type of user as well as the entity-relationship, screenshots from runtime and instructions on how to run the project.
