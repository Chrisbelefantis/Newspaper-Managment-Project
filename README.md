#Introduction
This was a semester project in Databases course where we had to build a managment system for a newspaper which consists from different

users such as Journalists, Editors, Administrators, and Publishers. For this project we used neatbeans IDE and mySQL for 

the database. Every uses logs in with his username and password if he is registered in the database the appropriate 

GUI with all the available options appears. Below we present all the requirments for every type of user as well as the entity-

relationship, screenshots from runtime and instructions on how to run the project.
