# Introduction
This was a semester project in Databases course where we had to build a managment system for a newspaper which 

consists from different  users such as Journalists, Editors, Administrators, and Publishers. For this project we 

used neatbeans IDE and mySQL for the database. Every user logs in with his username and password. If he is registered 

in the database the appropriate GUI with all the available options appears. Below we present all the requirments for 

every type of user as well as the entity-relationship, screenshots from runtime and instructions on how to run the project.


# Runtime Screenshots
First of all the **Login GUI** appears and the user enters his username and password.

doesn't fill the required ones an error message is displayed.

In the second tab the journalist can view all the articles that he has submitted as well as their current state. Also
he can select one article and by pressing "More Info" a pop up window appears with all the article details.

In the third tab he can edit the articles which have been either rejected from the editor in chief or are just applied 
waiting for the editor in chief to review them and either accept or reject them. The accepted articles cannot be eddited.
The journalist selects one article and for each change he wants to do the appropriate pop up appears.
